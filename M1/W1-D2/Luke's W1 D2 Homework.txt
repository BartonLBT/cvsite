/* EXERCISE 1
Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain concepts as you are speaking to a 12 years old
*/

/* Datatype can be one of three things. It can be what is known as "Script" which and be written and displayed in the console.log (e.g. "Hello my name is Luke".
The second type is numbers (e.g. 134, 54 or 12)
The third type Is Boolean which is meaning if somthing is True or False or the value is True or false (e.g. True, False, 1=1 (true, 10>1 (true), 10<1 (false)) */

/* EXERCISE 2
Describe what is a variable. Try to explain the concept as you are speaking to a 12 years old
*/

/* A Variable is a something that you can entre where the Value or meaning of it can be changed.
   For example You can change something called "thisVariant" to change it to a number, string or Boolean */

/* EXERCISE 3
Write the code to execute a SUM between the number 12 and 20.
*/

/* console.log(12 + 20)
 */

/* EXERCISE 4
Create a variable named x containing the number 12.
*/

/* let x = 12
 */

/* EXERCISE 5
Create a variable named name containing the string John Doe.
*/

/* let fullname = "John Doe"
 */

/* EXERCISE 6
Execute a SUBTRACTION between the number 12 and the variable x, which stores the value 12.
*/

/* let x = 12
   console.log(x - 12)
 */

/* EXERCISE 7
Create two variables: name1 and name2. name1 is equal to john, name2 is equal to John.
Verify that name1 is different from name2. 
Verify then, that name1 and name2 are equals if both lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/

/* let name1 = "john"
   let name2 = "John"
   console.log(name1)
   console.log(name2)
   console.log(name1.toLowerCase === name2.toLowerCase)
   */

/* EXERCISE 8
Create a variable named x (its value must be less than 10). Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1 print "one", if 5 print "five" etc.).
*/

/* let x = 5
   if(x) {
    console.log("Five")
}
//(I think that is what is being asked.)
     */

/* EXERCISE 9
[Extra] Insert a value in a variable based on the resut of a ternary if (topic not covered during lesson, try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together ;) )
*/

/* let chocolate = 100
let sushi = 500
let food = (sushi >= 100) ? "chocolate" : "sushi";
console.log(food)

//..............I tried...... ;D

*/

/* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
